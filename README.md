junit4demo
==========

An example of a very simple project with JUnit4 tests.

## Try it out

1. Make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (I suggest the *Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers* version) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine (`git clone git@github.com:csc301-fall2014/junit4demo.git`)
3. Open the project in Eclipse:
  * File --> Import --> Existing Project Into Workspace
  * Select the root of the repository (i.e. The folder containing pom.xml) as the root directory for the project.
  * **Important:** Make sure that the *Copy project into workspace* option is **unchecked**. 
4. Run the unit tests: Right-click `src/test/java/junit4demo/TestPerson.java`  --> Run As --> JUnit Test
